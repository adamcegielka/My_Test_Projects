# My test Procejcts
In this repository I'm posting my projects that I did on my own as part of gaining more practice with web application testing.

### Guru99 Bank
> The first project is to test the Guru99 Bank application (the project is in progress)<br>
> For testing, I used tools like these:<br>
> - [TestRail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/)<br>
> - [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/jira/)<br>
> - [TEMPMAIL](https://temp-mail.org/pl/)<br> 
> - [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/)
